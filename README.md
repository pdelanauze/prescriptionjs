# PrescriptionJS

An easy way to inject your custom javascript in any webpage through a bookmarklet.

You need a couchdb instance and the soca gem.
Checkout the code, update the credentials in the .couchapprc for you couchdb instance, run a `soca push`, and hit up the URL corresponding to that database (e.g. http://localhost:5984/prescriptionjs/_design/prescriptionjs/index.html)

From there, add the bookmarklet you want to use onto your bookmarks bar, and start writing prescriptions for your soon to be favorite websites!
